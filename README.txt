This is a description of the program.

Main.cpp
--------
Objects of type Point, Line, Triangle, etc... are created.
Objects are then stored in csv format (csv file is created if it does not exist; if it exists, values are overwritten).
csv file is then closed. Objects in main memory are deleted.
csv file is then re-opened. Objects are dynamically created using paramaters defined by csv file.
